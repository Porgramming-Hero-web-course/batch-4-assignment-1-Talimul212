# Why Are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases

Type guards in TypeScript are essential for narrowing down types, ensuring more precise type checks during runtime. They provide a way to define conditions that refine the type of a variable, which can help avoid runtime errors and improve code safety.

## Why Type Guards Are Necessary

Without type guards, TypeScript can only infer types statically, leading to possible runtime issues when the types are not what we expect. Type guards allow us to refine types within conditional statements, ensuring the correct behavior and reducing bugs.

## Types of Type Guards

### 1. **`typeof` Type Guards**

`typeof` is a simple type guard used to narrow down primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.

### Example:

```typescript
function isString(value: string | number): boolean {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    return true; // TypeScript knows 'value' is a string here
  }
  return false;
}
```
